<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

[REST Countries API with theme switcher](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rest-countries-api-with-color-theme-switcher-5cacc469fec04111f7b848ca) is a project that I built as a challenge from the [frontendmentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io) website.


### Challenge Brief

Your challenge is to integrate with the REST Countries API to pull country data and display it like in the designs.

You can use any JavaScript framework/library on the front-end such as React or Vue. You also have complete control over which packages you use to do things like make HTTP requests or style your project.

Your users should be able to:

* See all countries from the API on the homepage
* Search for a country using an input field
* Filter countries by region
* Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
* Click through to the border countries on the detail page
* Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode (optional)

### Built With

This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Leave any add-ons/plugins for the acknowledgements section. Here are a few examples.
* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/)
* [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
* [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)
* [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/)
* [React Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
* [Rest Countries API](https://restcountries.eu/)
* [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started


### Installation and Setup

Clone down this repository. You will need `node` and `npm` installed globally on your machine.  

Installation:

`npm install`  

To Start Server:

`npm start`  

To Visit App:

`localhost:3000`  


### Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.


### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```


## Project Status


### Current
Adding styles for larger devices and working on the filter by region option.

### Next steps:
- [ ] Adding styles for larger devices.
- [ ] Adding a filter by category functionality.
- [ ] Adding a theme color switch.
- [ ] Adding a loading component.
- [ ] Add animations.
- [ ] Optimizing and refactoring code.

## Reflection

  - This is a side project to test out my skills.
  - P.S I love building this!
  - Initially I was planning on building this with Context API, however after a while it became so cumbersome that I ended up with some spaghetti code and decided to hard reset to my previous commit. The reason I decided to go with Context API is because I thought Redux would be an overkill for this small app and it gets quite repetitive with creating constants, acitions, reducers, combining reducers etc. Fortunately, I found out about an amazing third-party app, built by the Redux team, called Redux Toolkit which is in my opinion very elegant and helps you write very clean code. In just 20 minutes I got the hang of it and I feel like I just won the lottery today. I love it!
  - P.S by hour 8 I was wondering why my custom component is not rendering and after careful debugging, I saw I wasn't returning it from my map function... this is when I knew I needed a break 

#### Goals:  

I have spent a total of 22 hours building this project.

* **Main Goal:** Get to that theme switcher! Whoo
